# weatherApp

[LiveDemo](https://vladius9512.github.io/weatherApp/)

### What i learned doing this project?

-   First time i used an API
-   Got to practice with async and await
-   Got to practice some more with how i manage my data and how to write cleaner code
-   It was my first responsive design and learned about @media screen
-   This time i started from the data manipulation and worked my way to styling. It was better, and setting different files from the start helped a lot
-   First time i took location from user when they acces the page.
